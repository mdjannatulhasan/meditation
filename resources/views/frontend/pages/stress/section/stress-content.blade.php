                    The long-term effects of stress can be detrimental to our health and also lead to anxiety and depression. Meditation for stress relief and mindfulness techniques can help to counter these effects by lowering stress hormones and decreasing inflammation in the body.

                    Life is demanding and full of hassles — and therefore an ongoing activation of stress responses in our bodies. For most people, stress has become a norm and many might even have entered a state of prolonged or chronic stress which comes with many other health problems, including anxiety, inflammation, autoimmune and heart diseases, depression, sleep disorders, diabetes, migraine, and memory loss — to only name a few. While stress is a natural response of our body, it should be natural to not see chronic stress as manageable or tolerable. Because it is not.

                <p class="ps-400 c00 s26 p-title">The Principles of Meditation for Stress Management</p>
                <p class="ps-400 c60 s20">To understand how to manage stress effectively in our own lives, we need to consider four key principles:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle" class="p-ul-1">
                    <li class="ps-400 c60 s20">Not all stress is bad</li>
                    <li class="ps-400 c60 s20">Stress can occur on different time scales</li>
                    <li class="ps-400 c60 s20">No two people stress the same way</li>
                    <li class="ps-400 c60 s20">Stress manifests itself holistically</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="ps-400 c60 s20">
                    There is no single kind of stress, and therefore no one-size-fits-all solution. The goal is not to eradicate all stress forever, since we know some excitement, challenge and risk is part of the spice of life. Rather, we need solutions that reflect the complexity of stress itself, and help us:
                </p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle" class="p-ul-2">
                    <li class="ps-400 c60 s20">Discern mindfully between healthy and unhealthy stress</li>
                    <li class="ps-400 c60 s20">on all time scales and with different kinds of stress,</li>
                    <li class="ps-400 c60 s20">in a way that works for us as unique individuals,</li>
                    <li class="ps-400 c60 s20">and for our entire selves – body, heart, and mind.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="w-1030 mx-auto">
            <p class="ps-400 cff s20">
                An effective stress management strategy is about understanding how and why we stress, so we can work with our body’s natural responses and restore a healthy equilibrium. In whatever way stress manifests in a person’s life, the key to dismantling the stress response is to stop it before it begins, i.e. in the early stages of perception.

                Meditation for stress is a powerful tool as it allows us to cultivate a greater sense of awareness and presence, and stronger emotional control and self-regulation. Stress begins in our mind. While meditating we bring our attention to the present moment and learn to control our jumbled thinking patterns (monkey mind). Our self-awareness increases, while negative emotions decrease. We create a space that brings us clarity on what demands and emotions are truly important and valid. Meditation can fortify us against the stress of life because it empowers us to be conscious of what unfolds in our experience, instead of merely reacting unconsciously to it.

                tudies have also shown that meditation — especially mindfulness practices — impacts the serotonin production of our brain. Serotonin is an essential neurotransmitter mainly contributing to our health and wellbeing. Its jobs include regulating our sleep patterns, energy, appetite and memory. A lack of serotonin can often cause stress or increase stress levels. Meditation also releases dopamine, GABA and endorphins – neurotransmitters responsible for a good mood and the ability to control fear and anxiety.
