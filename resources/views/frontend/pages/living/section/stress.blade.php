                <p class="ps-400 c60 s20">Meditation has become the “in” thing to do.
                    People from all walks of life are into yoga and meditation. <br>
                    But often there are unrealistic expectations; some are seeking an escape from the stress, emotions and the hardships of life. <br>
                    Especially in the beginning, many become disillusioned and disheartened. <br>
                    Some begin to feel that there is something wrong with them because they have not reached enlightenment in a certain amount of time. <br>
                    Many are finding out that sitting on a cushion for 30 minutes a day is not what they were expecting. <br>
                    They are finding that instead of peace, enlightenment, and a reduction of stress, they are faced with intense emotions, tears and sometimes an intensification of the very things they are using meditation to escape from.</p>

                <p class="ps-400 c00 s26 p-title">The Myth</p>
                <p class="ps-400 c60 s20">
                    But therein lies one of the myths of meditation. <br>
                    It is not an escape from our situation, life’s problems, or intense emotions that sometimes cause us pain. <br>
                    In fact, meditation is often the very opposite of escape. <br>
                    It is a submersion into the very things we often want to run away from. <br>
                    Far from being an escape, meditation is a way of being with whatever is, and accepting it. <br>
                    And learning that it’s not only okay, but we are where we needed to be all along. <br>
                    There is no reason to avoid or run from life. <br>
                    Meditation is about showing up for, being with, and truly living and experiencing life.

                <p class="ps-400 c60 s20">
                    The rules for meditation are quite simple. <br>
                    There are no rules other than being with what is. <br>
                    Sometimes you may find yourself in a quiet place, a relaxing place, surrounded with beauty. <br>
                    By all means  this time to be mindful and meditate. <br>
                    However, there will be times you may find yourself in a hostile environment, the heat or cold are intense, the noise level is very distracting, and you are uncomfortable, anxious, and perhaps even afraid. <br>
                    With practice, we can learn to  this time to practice acceptance and even find peace. <br>
                    Of course this does not mean just sitting, walking, etc., and doing nothing to help improve your situation. <br>
                    What it does mean is that even in the most uncomfortable setting we can imagine, mindfulness, meditation is always possible.
